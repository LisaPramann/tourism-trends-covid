# Going back to normal? -  Observing tourism trends during the Covid-19 pandemic 

## Project Summary

Our **data journalism piece** evaluates Covid-19’s influence on tourism in Europe. While overall nightly tourist stays declined in the past 2 years, domestic tourism increased for most countries during the summer months. Data shows Europeans didn’t give up their holidays altogether, but instead embraced “staycations”, including increased camping trips and visits to parks. The trend of appreciating the outdoors may linger past the pandemic’s effect. Park visits stayed relatively high in 2021 and more people are being drawn to RV vacations. No matter how the pandemic evolves, it seems Europeans will find a way to adventure, even if it’s not far from home.

### Approach to the Project 

For the realization of the final data project we decided to look at the trends in tourism during the Covid-19 pandemic. First we looked at data and the dashboard from the World Tourism Organisation on international tourism and tried to get some flights data. However, it was too difficult to get the data in time. Moreover, the impact of pandemic counter measures varied across different continents which would have made interpretation difficult. That is why we focused on Europe, mainly using publicly available data on tourism from *Eurostat* and complemented by Index data on pandemic counter-measures and movement data from *Our World in Data*. Data downloaded from Eurostat were already slightly adjusted in excel format before they were imported. After we identifying some general trends, we first visualised them and then told our story around our findings. 


## Contribution Statement:

- *Lisa Pramann* set up the project workflow, created the map, the graphs and the story around the overall number of tourism in Europe (time-series and summer months) in relation to the stringency of countermeasures and the the pandemic's impact on European domestic tourism. 

- *Kathryn Malchow* created the Readme, worked on the visualization of camping rates and build that argument into the article and did the layout of the latter.

- *Renato Franco* analysed the frequency of park visits in Europe over the last months included it in the text and build a fine story around our arguments. 


### Project Limitations 

The data used  and the findings of our project have some limitations: 

- The Eurostat *tourism data* is still missing some values from France, Cyprus, Ireland, Greece and Bulgaria for some months, especially in the second half of 2021. When significant for the calculation of average values, we indicated this in our report. 
- Our World in Data is providing a helpful *index of the stringency of Covid-19 response measures* including nine metrics (e.g. school closures,  stay-at-home requirements). It is however not entirely clear the index calculated. Please visit their [website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-stringency-index) for further information  
- The data for the *frequency in parks visits* from Our World in Data is retrieved from Google Mobility Data compares to baseline days (the median value for the 5‑week period from January 3 to February 6, 2020). This [guidance](https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9825414?hl=en&ref_topic=9822927) elaborates on the potential impact of changes in weather and holiday seasons which explains the sharp increase. We find the data for the summer season are nevertheless well comparable and provides an overall picture of people's increased outdoor activities.   
- The data on *tourists' nights spent on camp sites* for Eurostat only supports our argument if, in addition, we filter for domestic tourism. This is mainly due to the decline in international tourism which we hereby acknowledge.
