##Observing tourism trends during the Covid-19 pandemic 

## Project Summary

Our **data journalism piece** evaluates Covid-19’s influence on tourism in Europe. While overall nightly tourist stays declined in the past 2 years, domestic tourism increased for most countries during the summer months. Data shows Europeans didn’t give up their holidays altogether, but instead embraced “staycations”, including increased camping trips and visits to parks. The trend of appreciating the outdoors may linger past the pandemic’s effect. Park visits stayed relatively high in 2021 and more people are being drawn to RV vacations. No matter how the pandemic evolves, it seems Europeans will find a way to adventure, even if it’s not far from home.

## Contribution Statement:

- *Lisa Pramann* set up the project workflow and created the map and the graphs and the story around the overall number of tourism in Europe (time-series and summer months) and the the pandemic's impact on European domestic tourism. 

- *Kathryn Malchow* created the Readme, worked on the visualization of camping rates and build that argument into the article. 

- *Renato Franco* analysed the frequency of park visits in Europe other the last months included it in the text and build a fine story around our arguments.
